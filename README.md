## 📌 Overview

▲ ＴＲＥ▼ＯＲ５ Injector is a FULL OPEN-SOURCE project, under MIT License, sophisticated & easy to use.

▲ .DLLs injection tool that uses manual mapping method to load in Processes.

▲ .DLLs into target processes (YOUR_PROCESS.exe) without relying on LoadLibrary.

▲ It supports x86 and x64 processes, includes SEH (Structured Exception Handling) support.

▲ Cleans up traces after injection for stealth.

---

⚠️ IMPORTANT: **This injector has been specifically designed and adapted for use with Daniel Kuprinski's "Osiris.dll" library, although you can use it on other games and inject other .dlls (Osiris.dll is a safe product, be careful with other .dlls of dubious origin).**

### 🔧 How It Works

#### Manual Mapping Process

    Reads the target DLL into memory
    Allocates memory in the target process
    Relocates imports, applies base relocations, and handles TLS callbacks
    Executes the DLL's entry point (DllMain)

#### Post-Injection Cleanup

    Optionally removes PE headers
    Cleans unnecessary sections (.pdata, .rsrc, .reloc)
    Adjusts memory protections for stealth

#### Shellcode Execution

    Uses a custom shellcode stub to perform the injection
    Handles exception directories for stability

## 📥 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

    Windows 11
    Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community (for compilation)
    Administrator privileges (for debugging rights)
    Download: https://github.com/s0mbra-1973/Trevor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
    ＴＲＥ▼ＯＲ５ source-code Coming soon, Only TREVOR4 Source Code is available.

### 🛠️ Compilation

    Open the project in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community
    Build in Release mode (x86 or x64, depending on target)

### 🚀 Usage:

    RUN ＴＲＥ▼ＯＲ５.exe as Administrator, select the .dll file to inject, Press Inject button.
    
## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions for Beginners:

1. **Run Your Game**:
   - The game must be running and in the main menu, not in a match/game. 

2. **Download ＴＲＥ▼ＯＲ５** (source-code Coming soon, Only TREVOR4 Source Code is available).:
   - Download and extract from https://github.com/s0mbra-1973/Trevor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
   - Compile it with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community.
  
3. Run ＴＲＥ▼ＯＲ５.exe as Administrator, select the .dll file to inject, Press Inject button.

### ⚠️ Is it completely 100% undetectable Anti-cheats Systems?

Like everything in life, you're never 100% secure. Valve spends millions of dollars preventing the use of cheats.
That said, I've been using it for months without any issues or detections, but it all depends largely on the .DLL you inject.
Osiris.dll (https://github.com/danielkrupinski/Osiris) doesn't cause any problems or get detected, at least for now.

### ⚠️ Why Windows 11 Detects It as a Virus

Trevor4.exe is a DLL injector that uses manual mapping techniques to inject a dynamic link library (DLL) into the memory space of another process. This type of code is often flagged as malicious by antivirus software, including Microsoft Defender on Windows 11, due to the techniques it employs, such as process memory manipulation, shellcode injection, and remote thread creation, which are common in malware, even though they can also be used for legitimate purposes.

### ⚠️ Suspicious Techniques:
- The use of functions like VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, and CreateRemoteThread is typical in malware injectors, triggering Microsoft Defender's heuristic detection.
- Shellcode and manipulation of import tables or relocations may be interpreted as attempts to hide malicious code.
- Temporarily disabling certain memory sections or cleaning PE headers is also considered suspicious behavior.

### ⚠️ How to Validate ＴＲＥ▼ＯＲ５.exe in Windows 11

To make Windows 11 (and Microsoft Defender) consider Trevor4.exe or Osiris.dll safe, you can follow these steps:

### Temporarily Disable Real-Time Protection:

- Trevor4.exe is safe and you’re using it in a controlled environment:
    - Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Virus & Threat Protection > Manage Settings.
    - Temporarily disable Real-time protection.
    - Run Trevor4.exe. 
    - Re-enable real-time protection immediately afterward.
    - Caution: This is not a permanent solution, as it disables protection for all files, which can be risky.

- Add an Exception in Microsoft Defender:
    - If you plan to use this program repeatedly:
    - Go to Windows Security > Virus & Threat Protection > Manage Settings > Exclusions.
    - Add an exclusion for the folder containing the executable or the specific file. (Trevor4.exe and/or Osiris.dll)
    - This tells Defender to ignore your program.
    - Caution: Ensure the file is safe before excluding it, as this prevents Defender from scanning it.

### ⚠️ Warning & Limitations

- Anti-Cheat Detection: Manual mapping is stealthier than LoadLibrary, but some anti-cheats may still detect it.
- I am not responsible for any type of damage that may cause to your systems, potential Steam account loss or any other problem you may have.
- 32/64-bit Mismatch: You cannot inject a 64-bit DLL into a 32-bit process (or vice versa).
- Stability: Some DLLs may crash if they rely on certain load-time features.
